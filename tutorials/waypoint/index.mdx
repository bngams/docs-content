Waypoint allows developers to deploy, manage, and observe their applications through a consistent abstraction of underlying infrastructure. Waypoint works with Nomad, Kubernetes, ECS and many other platforms.

Waypoint is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp that focuses on simplifying the deployment and release workflows for applications. The main goal of Waypoint is to abstract away the complexities of different deployment targets and provide a consistent interface for developers and operators. It allows developers to define their application's build and deployment configurations using a simple and declarative configuration file.

With Waypoint, you can define a set of steps or actions that need to be executed during the build, deployment, and release process. These actions can include building the application, packaging it into a container, deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster, and more. 

## Waypoint plugins for Scaleway

We provide plugins for waypoint, that add support for Scaleway.
Currently, the only plugin available is `container`.

## Plugin installation

### From releases

- [Download the zip](https://github.com/scaleway/waypoint-plugin-scaleway/releases) of the latest version for your architecture.
- Unzip the plugin by running the following command: `unzip waypoint-plugin-scaleway-container_*.zip -d ~/.config/.waypoint/plugins/`

> **Note**
> On macOS, you will have to execute the following command to ignore Apple's developer authenticity verification:
> ```
> xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.config/.waypoint/plugins/waypoint-plugin-scaleway-container
> ```

### From sources
- Clone the repository on your local machine.
- Run the following command to build and install the plugin: `make all install`


## Usage

```hcl
deploy {
  use "scaleway-container" {
    port = 80
    namespace_id = "xxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx"
    region = "fr-par"
  }
}
```
API keys are loaded from [Scaleway's config](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-go/tree/master/scw#scaleway-config) default profile and can be overwritten by environment variables.

A list of all options can be found in [container's documentation](./docs/container.md)

Waypoint is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp that focuses on simplifying the deployment and release workflows for applications.

The main goal of Waypoint is to abstract away the complexities of different deployment targets and provide a consistent interface for developers and operators.
It allows developers to deploy, manage, and observe their applications using a simple and declarative configuration file.
The tool works with Nomad, Kubernetes, ECS and many other platforms.


## Waypoint plugins for Scaleway

We provide plugins for Waypoint, that add support for Scaleway.
Currently, the only plugin available is `container`.
